            A rich history and a diverse culture. England is a country that is a
            part of the United Kingdom (UK). A lot of people think the UK is
            just England, but the UK Consists of England, Scotland, and Wales.
            England is known for its British empire, and the royals. If I, and
            many others think about the English we think: Tea. English people
            are very big tea drinkers. They have tea in the morning, afternoon,
            after dinner all day. Another thing I think about when I think about
            England is the red busses, the iconic red busses. </em></p>

          The capital city of England is London. London is a global hub for
          finance, culture, and politics. London is known for its rich history,
          diverse culture, iconic landmarks etc. Some of the landmarks of London
          are Buckingham Palace, The Big Ben, The British Museum, and the London
          eye. Especially during the Christmas holidays London is beautifully
          decorated for Christmas. The Streets of London are decorated with
          Christmas Lights and decorations. The streets I highly recommend are
          Regent Street, Oxford Street, Convent Garden & Carnaby street. There
          are a couple of famous streets and events that are well known around
          tourists. I have been to London twice, November 2022 and 2023. The
          perfect time to explore the Christmas feeling in London. Let's look at
          the perfect must visit spots together.

          <h3>Winter Wonderland</h3>
          <p>
            The Hyde Park is a huge park in London, where every year during the
            holidays Winter Wonderland is being hosted. It is a large festive
            Christmas event that typically runs from late November to early
            January. Many tourists come here, but also a lot of local people.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Winter wonderland you can go on attractions, that are suitable for
            all ages. These include outdoor ice-skating ring, a Christmas market,
            ice sculptures, scary houses, Ferris wheel, the ice mountain etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Winter Wonderland hosts traditional Christmas markets with wooden
            chalets selling various types of products. From handmade crafts to
            food and drinks. The park has different types of food like German
            food, mulled wine, roasted chestnuts, doner etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we were their music came from every corner, there is a lot of
            live entertainment. Such as circus shows, live music, comedy
            performances etc. There was not one quit spot in the wonderland.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were fireplaces, Bavarian village, ice bars and a lot of other
            cool extractions. Entry to the park costs around 5-7 pounds in the
            evening. Free in the morning and every attraction or food stand has
            different prices. I highly recommend going to Winter Wonderland, I
            went with my family and friends and had an amazing time. Even if you
            don't like going on attractions, just being there is enough to feel
            the Christmas spirit. </p>

          <h3>The Big Ben</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most iconic landmarks in London and a symbol of the city is
            Big Ben. The name Big Ben refers to the bell inside the clock tower,
            not the tower itself. The tower is known as the clock tower which is
            now originally referred as the Elizabeth Tower.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tower was completed in 1859 and designed by the architect Augustus
            Pugin and engineer Sir Charles Barry. The tower stands at the north
            end of the Palace of Westminster by the River Thames.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lately the Big Ben has been renovated and restored. Because of this
            the Big ben was sparkling. When I was there it looked brand new. It
            was a very busy street with a bridge and pubs along the side of the
            road.

          <h3>The London Eye</h3>
          <img src="images/londoneye.jpg" alt="the london eye" class="londoneye">
          <p>
            Along the River Thames you can see the London Eye. The London Eye is a
            giant Ferris wheel. It has become a prominent part of London's
            skyline. I remember when we were about to land, while sitting in the
            plane I saw the London city skyline with the Big Ben and the London
            eye. It was so cool, everything looked miniature.
          </p>
          <p>
            An interesting fact about the London Eye is that it was initially
            intended as a temporary structure. However, due to its popularity, it
            became a landmark of London. The London Eye is 443 feet, 135 meters
            long and was designed by architect David Marks and Julie Barfield. It
            consists of 32 capsules and carries around 800 passengers during a
            30-minute rotation. Unfortunately, I haven't been on the London Eye.
