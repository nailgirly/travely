                            <p> The Griffith Observatory is an iconic and historic landmark. This landmark is perched on
                                the
                                southern slope of Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park.
                                The observatory offers breathtaking panoramic views of the Los Angeles skyline and is a
                                popular destination.
                                The architecture is a blend of Art Deco and Greek Revival styles. The observatory
                                features
                                white concrete columns,
                                this is a feature that repeatedly comes back in the Greek art and architecture. The
                                observatory was opened to the public in 1935.
                                It has since served as an important center for public astronomy, scientific exhibitions
                                etc.
                                The history of the universe, the stars, planetarium shows, and space exploration are
                                being
                                studied at the observatory.
                                There is an array of telescopes available for public use. Because of the telescopes the
                                visitors can observe celestial objects
                                and phenomena such as planets, stars, and the moon etc. The visitors are always guided
                                by
                                knowledgeable staff members,
                                the staff members offer explanations and insights.
                                Aside from its scientific offerings, the observatory's location allows visitors to enjoy
                                the
                                surrounding hiking trails,
                                stunning views, and nature. It has been featured in numerous films and series.
                                I have seen this location in the show lucifer and movies like Jurassic Park, Charlie's
                                angels etc.
                                It was crazy to see the spots where I've been back in shows and movies, knowing that
                                some of
                                the actors I watch have been at the same places as me. </p>

                    <h3>The Hollywood Sign</h3>
                    <article class="info-layout">
                        <p> From the Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park, you can see the amazing known Hollywood Sign.
                            Hollywood is known for its entertainment industry, when most people think about Hollywood,
                            they either think about the Hollywood Signs or the famously known celebrity stars. The sign
                            was
                            originally created in 1923 as an advertisement for a real estate development called
                            “Hollywood land”.
                            The letters are made of 45-foot-tall white capital corrugated metal, spelling out the word
                            “Hollywood”.
                            The Hollywood sign is positioned on the face of Mount Lee in the Hollywood Hills, with a
                            stunning view.
                            When I went hiking on to the Griffith observatory, I saw the beautiful sign. And on the
                            other side the
                            gorgeous view of the city of Los Angeles. Of course, like every other tourist I wanted to
                            get closer to
                            the sign but access to the sign itself is restricted. However, you can get a good view from
                            several hiking
                            trails and viewpoints. </p>

                            destinations located in Glendale, California. During the holidays these 2 malls are
                            beautifully decorated,

                            extensive selection of shops and boutiques. Every time I have been to Glendale, la I have
                            been to this mall.
                            It has almost every shop you can think of. The American classics like target, food courts
                            etc.

                            ambience. The Americana at Brand is a place of its own. I love walking here during the
                            holidays, hearing the Christmas music
                            and seeing people live, laugh and love.

                    <h3>Will Rogers State Beach</h3>
                    <p>Will Rogers State Beach is one of the popular beaches located in the Pacific Palisades, Los
                        Angeles. This beach is named after

                        stunning views of the Santa Monica Mountains.
                        I have been here on December 18th of 2021. I went there with my cousins and some delicious
                        food we got at a famous spot nearby.
                        The sound of the waves and the beautiful sunset gives me a very calm and relaxing feeling.
                        We got pull out chairs, sat on the beach
                        and talked about our lives. This is one of my favorite core memories, that I will remember
                        forever.

                    <h3>Van Gogh Art Exhibition</h3>
                    <p> In the famous Los Angeles, there are many art exhibitions, one of my favorite ones that I
                        have been to myself is the Van Gogh exhibition.
                        I am from the Netherlands, just like the artist van Gogh. It was cool to see his art in L.A.
                        The exhibition consisted of two huge rooms
                        where the art of Van Gogh was displayed on the walls, just like a video. In the background
                        classical music of different various artists
                        was playing. And during the show they gave some people fake sunflowers. On the ground there
                        were circles placed where people could sit,
                        some people came with their kids and others went as duos. I was at the exhibition with my
                        cousins and aunts. I took many pictures and video's
                        here; I recommend this experience to anyone who likes arts and shows. </p>

                    <h3>Hollywood</h3>
                    <p> Hollywood is known as the heart of the entertainment industry. Hollywood is worldwide known
                        for its film and television productions, symbolizes
                        the glamour, creativity, and allure of the movie-making world. As we talked about the
                        Hollywood sign is the sign of Hollywood. Hollywood is known
                        for the iconic Hollywood sign, the Walk of Fame and historic theaters that have hosted
                        countless movie premieres.
                        The area Hollywood is home to major film studios. The major film studios that can be see
                        there include Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios,
                        Warner Bros etc. Hollywood is also known for its nightlife, with a bustling urban district,
                        many historical landmarks, trendy restaurants etc. is
                        this the perfect place to visit as a tourist. </p>

                    <p>My experience in Hollywood was great. It was like walking in a new world, it is very
                        different than other parts of Los Angeles. It was very busy with
                        people walking everywhere. People dressed up as characters and taking pictures with others,
                        movie premieres going on. The Walk of Fame stars that displayed
                        different personalities and celebrities was very long, the streets were filled with stars
                        where you could walk for hours. The stars are usually displayed with
                        a name and an icon, the icon stands for the reason this person got famous.</p>

                    <p>An interesting thing about the Walk of Fame is that some stars are still empty. There were a
                        couple of people that offered a picture with your own name displayed
                        on an empty star. Me and my family did this activity. It was very expensive; I think 2
                        dollars for one letter, so it ended up being around 20 dollars per person.
                        I chose a microphone because I love singing. After the man displayed the letters, we took
                        pictures. I think this is such a genius business model, just placing a
                        couple of plastic letters that look like the Hollywood letters makes you a lot of money.

                    <h3>Favorite Food & Drink Spots</h3>
                    <p> One of my favorite foods to eat in Los Angeles is bagels. There are two spots I always get
                        them from Noah's New York Bagels and Starbucks. Noah's New York bagels
                        makes freshly baked bagels that sell out quickly. The spot I go to is in Burbank. I am
                        someone that likes a classic bagel, a plain bagel with cream cheese. But they
                        have a lot more kinds. The bagels at Starbucks are also delicious, crispy on the outside
                        soft on the inside. The bagels in the Netherlands are a lot different than the
                        bagels of the USA, I think it has something to do with the flour. I have tried making
                        American bagels so many times already, but it never turns out the same.</p>

                    <p>My two favorited drinks at Starbucks are: A strawberry acai no lemonade light ice and a
                        caramel frap. You can wake me up in the middle of the night with a strawberry
                        acai and a heated-up bagel with cream cheese. Highly recommend!</p>

                    <p>Chick-Fil-A and In' n Out burger are my two favorite spots for French fries. Both very
                        different, but very good. The Chick-Fil-A fries are in a waffle type of form,
                        paired with their ranch a delicious meal. The In' n Out fries are freshly cut, and amazing
                        with their ranch. The thing about American fast food is that it is often not
                        well prepared because they must make a lot of it, but I can guarantee that these spots are
                        well made.</p>

                    <p> To conclude this chapter, I <em>love</em> Los Angeles and the USA. I highly recommend to
                        visit!</p>
