                        streets.
                        When I turned 18 years old my mom took me to Paris for the first time in my life, this trip
                        was amazing
                        And meant alot to me. </em> </p>

                    <div class="text-box1">
                        <p> The iconic symbol of Paris and France, an architectural brilliance. The Eiffel Tower was
                            designed by
                            enigineer Gustave Eiffel. Thats where the name Eiffel Tower comes from. It was
                            construccted
                            for the
                            1889 world's fair. The tower is 324 meters long (1,063 feet) and has held the titel of
                            the
                            world's tallest structure for
                            over 40 years.
                            When we went to the Eiffel Tower we went up the tower with elevators, there were a lot
                            of
                            people on the tower itself.
                            The view was amzing, you could also see alot of greenery. The tower is surrounded by
                            greenery. When I was up there I kept thinking
                            how amazing would the view be at night when all the lights are on. We went to the
                            highest
                            part of the tower.
                            On one of the floors there was a whole restaurant, swings, cafe's etc. Before I went on
                            the
                            tower I couldn't
                            imagine that all of that could be up there. There were also souvenir stores. </p>

                <h3>The Louvre Museum</h3>
                <article class="info-layout">
                    <p> The Louvre museum is one of the best art museums. The museum was originally a royal palace,
                        which was transformed in
                        a public museum in 1793. The museum has a very big diverse collection of artworks, including
                        ancient artifacts, sculptures,
                        paintings etc.
                        Some very known and popular pieces are the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci, the Venus de Milo
                        etc.
                        My experience in the Louvre was amazing. Me and my mom went there for almost 10 hours which
                        is
                        crazy to me. A good tip is to buy your tickets
                        before hand! The lines were so long but we had prepaid tickets, with an audio system. We got
                        our
                        nintendo ds's and walked around the museum.
                        I've been to many museums before, but I can confidently say that this one had the most
                        beautiful
                        artworks I have seen in my <strong>life</strong>.
                        They had art from so many countries, from golden rooms to the Mona Lisa, dutch art, persian
                        art.
                        Some pieces were so big we wondered how they got it in there.
                        In paris i took a total of 2.166 pictures and videos, most of them were probably from the
                        Louvre. I recommend this museum to anyone, you have to see this <em>atleast</em>
                        once in your life!</p>

                <h3>Arc de Thriomphe</h3>
                <article class="info-layout">
                    <p> This was my favorite outdoor landmark of paris, the Arc de Thriomphe which stands for
                        Triumphal
                        Arc.
                        This monument is iconic, located at Champs-élysées.
                        Champs-élysées is one of the city's most famous avenues, which I will talk about in the next
                        paragraph. The Arc de Thriomphe was designed to commemorate
                        France's military triumphs and honor those who fought and died for the country. It was
                        completed
                        in
                        1836.
                        The monument has a neoclassical designed that has been influenced by Roman Architecture's.
                        It
                        has
                        alot of detail to it. Around the Arch there is a roundabout
                        which is crazy busy, and not safe I dont even know how it is legal. A fun fact about the
                        arch is
                        that the names of french victories and generals are inscribed
                        on its surfaces.
                        Visitors can climb to the top of the Arc for amazing views of Paris, I have seen that the
                        view is the best one in Paris. You can even see the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.
                        I remember us being to tired to go up there, because there were a lot of stairs.
                        I will definitly do it next time!</p>

                    <p> There are many more spots in Paris that have pretty views etc.
                        Paris is very big, but public transport will help you get anywhere.
                        Everything is pretty close to eachoter!
                        I recommend going to places like the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Thriomphe twice.
                        I went to both of them during the day and at night. On the first
                        night we arrived pretty late, but still went to the Eiffel tower. It was during october of
                        2022
                        so the leaves were falling as we were walking to the Eiffel tower.
                        It was a magical moment, and a lifelong memory. </p>

                <article class="info-layout">
                    <p> The Champs-élysées is one of the most famous avenues in the world. Stretching about 2 Km
                        (1,2
                        miles). The avenue has many shops, from regular shops
                        to very luxury shops. At the end you can find the Arc de Thriomphe. It is a busy avenue and
                        a
                        must
                        visit when your in paris.

                <h3>L'Avenue</h3>
                <article class="info-layout">
                    <p> A spot I recommend to eat at is L'Avenue. L'Avenue is a fashionable restaurant located on
                        Avenue
                        Montaigne. It is known for its popularity among locals,
                        but also celibrities. It owns a very chic and stylish atmosphere. I remember when sitting
                        there
                        everyone was dressed to fancly. Straight out of Paris.
                        It is a very busy spot so you may have to wait a bit to get seated. I recommend making a
                        reservation
                        during peak times. L'Avenue is a celebrity hotspot,
                        and has been in many films and shows. They have a beautiful outdoor terrace, the restaurant
                        is a
                        little smaller on the inside. It is important to note
                        that the restaurant is not very budget friendly, but I would recommend it. </p>

                    <p> Overall Paris was an amazing trip, and I highly recommend going there! Eventually I went
                        twice
                        in
                        the same year.</p>
